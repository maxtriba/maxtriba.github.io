#Hello
My name is Max Triba and I am a data scientist currently residing in Omaha, Nebraska. 
I specialize in large scale time series analysis with applications in supply - demand optimization. 

I think plots in base R are beautiful. Especially when [styled correctly.](http://motioninsocial.com/tufte/)

I'm interested in [photography](http://instagram.com/maxtriba).

I started a [programming meetup](https://www.facebook.com/javanotjava/) that meets on Thursday.
We're currently discussing the algorithmically trading crypto currencies using techniques based on [optimizing CVAR.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.7647.pdf)

The best way to contact me is via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/maxtriba).
