My name is Max Triba and I'm a senior business intelligence analyst in Omaha, Nebraska. I Program in R, Python, SQL (Server and Oracle), and I'm learning Swift. I'm interested in applied math, econometrics, and risk management. 

I'm into [photography](http://instagram.com/maxtriba), fast prime lenses, and I like a [fudgy](https://bluebottlecoffee.com/store/giant-steps) coffee bean.

You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxtriba).
