A weekly meeting I started in mid-2015 where anyone is welcome to join and discuss programming or applied math. Some of our recent topics have been [queueing models](http://www.perfdynamics.com/Tools/PDQ-R.html) and
[classification tree models](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/node/22). We've also done a handful of the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems.
